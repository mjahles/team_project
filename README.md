    Future Branch/Feature review Protocol
We each manage our own feature branches.  After we complete the given feature we check in with everyone else and compare our branches together to make sure that there are no conflicts.  Then we push to our intermediate branch (master) where we keep that change until it has been verified to cause no issues at which point we will push that code up to our final branch (production).
    
    External tool for communication/planning
We have our team discord server that we can use for any communication regarding the project.  Discord works really well since its easy to use and you can insert code snippets that are formatted correctely and are easy to read.

    Communication Touchpoints
We should implement a daily scrum standup meeting structure.
    Question 1.    What did you work on since we had our last check-in meeting?
    Question 2.    What are you going to work on between now and our next check-in meeting?
    Question 3.    What are some perceived roadblocks or challenges that you think might prevent you from completing this new task?
